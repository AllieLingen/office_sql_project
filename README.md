# office_sql_project
Creating a database for Scratton's top Paper Company and building queries to learn more about their business.

# Database Architecture and Relationships
View the 'company_database_structure.png' to see the tables within the company's database, the attributes within each table, and how they relate to each other.

# Creating Tables and Executing Queries for Analysis
View the 'office_queries.sql' script to see my queries for creating the tables and additional queries I used for analysis to learn more about the company's work, the employees, and clients.I populated data in the tables outside of this script.

# Creating a Trigger for When New Employees are Added
View the 'office_trigger_add_employee.sql' to see my queries for creating a new Trigger table and instantiating the trigger for whenever a new employee is added. It is worth noting that this trigger query requires you to change your delimiter. I was using PopSQL for this project, which does not allow you to do this. So I had to create this trigger inside a MySQL terminal.
